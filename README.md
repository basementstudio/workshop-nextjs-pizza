## Featured Aspects of the Stack

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Things to Note

- It comes with Inter (it's better to host fonts here rather than getting them from google fonts).
- Pages, components, etc... are located under `/src`. If you are changing this, be sure to also update `tsconfig.json`'s `baseUrl`.

## Development

1. Install yarn:

   ```
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

2. Install the dependencies with:

   ```
   yarn
   ```

3. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
