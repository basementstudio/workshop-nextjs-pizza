# workshop-nextjs-pizza

Simple t-shirt shop project strongly spiced with [basement.studio](https://basement.studio/) flavor for the Next.js & Pizza Workshop.


## Our Commerce Toolkit

This project is powered by the [BSMNT Commerce Toolkit](https://github.com/basementstudio/commerce-toolkit) that we built to build fast and reliable storefronts that could handle crazy amounts of traffic.

### Phase 1: Product UI
`20 minutes`

- Using Tailwind
- Don't connect to shopify yet

### Phase 2: Integrate with Shopify using `@bsmnt/sdk-gen`
`15 minutes`

- Read the [guide](https://github.com/basementstudio/commerce-toolkit#bsmntsdk-gen).
- Use shopify graphql endpoint: `https://next-js-pizza-by-bsmnt.myshopify.com/api/2023-01/graphql`.
- Use public shopify storefront access token (found in `.env.example`).

### Phase 3: Add cart functionality using `@bsmnt/storefront-hooks`
`30 minutes`

- Why? Standard, uses react-query, can connect to any backend
- Read the [guide](https://github.com/basementstudio/commerce-toolkit#bsmntstorefront-hooks)
- Also you can check the [example with Shopify here](https://github.com/basementstudio/commerce-toolkit/blob/main/examples/nextjs-shopify/src/storefront/hooks/index.tsx)

### Phase 4: Deploy to Vercel
`5 minutes`

- Make sure you add the required environment variables

### BONUS: Bring the initial cart state from the server
